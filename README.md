# Soul Of Time
# Concept
An isometric adventure type game where you wander around the void realm to find monuments that you have to solve using “time mechanics”. The world is a looping map to give a false sense of an endless world. 

The goal of the game is to solve these puzzles and proceed to the next stage.

The goal will have a few roadblocks such as small variety of enemies and a boss battle that the player needs to fight before proceeding.
The game is considered to be play in a 2.5D environemnt as it would be more convenient when working in with unreal engine
# Software
The software used for this project was unreal engine due to it being one of the requirements of the assignments
